## First Dev Post - Blog Is Created

A bunch of my mates were making blogs with RSS feeds, i felt left out so i created this website yipeeee!!

## What am i going to do on the blog

Good question me, I am going to be posting development updates for any and all projects i do software and not software related

## How does this website work?

I am using Markdown eXtended(MDX) to create the content for these posts, then i am using NextJS to display the MDX content. The main purpose of this site was to create an Really Simple Syndication(RSS) feed so the MDX content is also turned into a RSS XML.
You can view the RSS xml at https:/blog.henry.games/rss.xml
